These override from the default yuidoc templates installed globally:

/usr/local/lib/node_modules/yuidocjs/themes/default

In order to load locally vs. requiring a network connection (required for developing on the train):

* Download yui-min.js into assets/js/yui-min.js
* Remove the reference to http://yui.yahooapis.com/
* Download all combo* .js files that it grabs from yahoo -> into assets/js/combo-min.js
* Download all combo* .css files -> into assets/css/combo-min.css
* Download sprite.png -> into assets/css/sprite.png
* Change all sprite.png references from url(http...sprite.png) to url(sprite.png) in combo-min.css
* Edit the main.handlebars to include assets/js/combo-min.js and assets/css/combo-min.css
